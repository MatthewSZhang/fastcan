FastCan is a feature selection method, which has following advantages:

#. Extremely **fast**.

#. Support unsupervised feature selection.

#. Support multioutput feature selection.

#. Skip redundant features.

#. Evaluate relative usefulness of features.

Check `Home Page <https://fastcan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest>`_ for more information.

Installation
------------

Install **FastCan** via PyPi:

* Run ``pip install fastcan``

Or via conda-forge:

* Run ``conda install -c conda-forge fastcan``

Getting Started
---------------
>>> from fastcan import FastCan
>>> X = [[ 0.87, -1.34,  0.31 ],
...     [-2.79, -0.02, -0.85 ],
...     [-1.34, -0.48, -2.55 ],
...     [ 1.92,  1.48,  0.65 ]]
>>> y = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [0, 0], [1, 0]] # Multioutput feature selection
>>> selector = FastCan(n_features_to_select=2, verbose=0).fit(X, y)
>>> selector.get_support()
array([ True,  True, False])
>>> selector.get_support(indices=True) # Sorted indices
array([0, 1])
>>> selector.indices_ # Indices in selection order
array([1, 0], dtype=int32)
>>> selector.scores_ # Scores for selected features in selection order
array([0.91162413, 0.71089547])
>>> # Here Feature 2 must be included
>>> selector = FastCan(n_features_to_select=2, indices_include=[2], verbose=0).fit(X, y)
>>> # We can find the feature which is useful when working with Feature 2 
>>> selector.indices_
array([2, 0], dtype=int32)
>>> selector.scores_
array([0.34617598, 0.95815008])
