==============================
Unsupervised feature selection
==============================

We can use :class:`FastCan` to do unsupervised feature selection.
The unsupervised application of :class:`FastCan` tries to select features, which
maximize the sum of the squared canonical correlation (SSC) with the principal
components (PCs) acquired from PCA (principal component analysis) of the feature
matrix :math:`X`. See the example below.

    >>> from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
    >>> from sklearn import datasets
    >>> from fastcan import FastCan
    >>> iris = datasets.load_iris()
    >>> X = iris["data"]
    >>> pca = PCA(n_components=2)
    >>> X_pcs = pca.fit_transform(X)
    >>> selector = FastCan(n_features_to_select=2, verbose=0).fit(X, X_pcs[:, :2])
    >>> selector.indices_
    array([2, 1], dtype=int32)

.. note::
    There is no guarantee that this unsupervised :class:`FastCan` will select
    the optimal subset of the features, which has the highest SSC with PCs.
    Because :class:`FastCan` selects features in a greedy manner, which may lead to
    suboptimal results.
