Forecasting with (Nonlinear) AR models

.. currentmodule:: fastcan.narx

In this examples, we will demonstrate how to use :func:`make_narx` to build (nonlinear)
AutoRegressive (AR) models for time-series forecasting.
The time series used isthe monthly average atmospheric CO2 concentrations
from 1958 and 2001.
The objective is to forecast the CO2 concentration till nowadays with
initial 18 months data.

# Prepare data
# ------------
# We use the data consists of the monthly average atmospheric CO2 concentrations
# (in parts per million by volume (ppm)) collected at the Mauna Loa Observatory
# in Hawaii, between 1958 and 2001.

from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml

co2 = fetch_openml(data_id=41187, as_frame=True)
co2 = co2.frame
co2.head()

# %%
# First, we process the original dataframe to create a date column and select it along
# with the CO2 column. Here, date columns is used only for plotting, as there is no
# inputs (including time or date) required in AR models.

import pandas as pd

co2_data = co2[["year", "month", "day", "co2"]].assign(
    date=lambda x: pd.to_datetime(x[["year", "month", "day"]])

# %%
# We will preprocess the dataset by taking a monthly average to smooth the data.
# The months which have no measurements were collected should not be dropped.
# Because AR models require the time intervals between the two neighboring measurements
# are consistent.
# As the results, the NaN values should be kept as the placeholders to maintain the
# time intervals, and :class:`NARX` can handle the missing values properly.

# For plotting, the time axis for training is from March, 1958 to December, 2001,
# which is converted it into a numeric, e.g., March, 1958 will be converted to 1958.25.
# The time axis for test is from March, 1958 to nowadays.

# Nonlinear AR model
# ------------------
# We can use :func:`make_narx` to easily build a nonlinear AR model, which does not
# has a input. Therefore, the input ``X`` is set as ``None``.
# :func:`make_narx` will search 10 polynomial terms, whose maximum degree is 2 and
# maximum delay is 9.

    max_delay=max_delay,
    poly_degree=2,
    verbose=0,
)
model.fit(None, co2_data["co2"], coef_init="one_step_ahead")
print_narx(model, term_space=27)

# %%
# Forecasting performance
# -----------------------
# As AR model does not require input data, the input ``X`` in :func:`predict`
# is used to indicate total steps to forecast. The initial conditions ``y_init``
# is the first 18 months data from the ground truth, which contains missing values.
# If there is no missing value given to ``y_init``, we can only use ``max_delay``
# number of samples as the initial conditions.
# However, if missing values are given to ``y_init``, :class:`NARX` will break
# the data into multiple time series according to the missing values. For each
# time series, at least ``max_delay`` number of samples, which does not have
# missing values, are required to do the proper forecasting.
# The results show our fitted model is capable to forecast to future years with
# only first 18 months data.
